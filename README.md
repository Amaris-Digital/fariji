Use the following criteria to set your environment variables:
* `.env` - Common variables that are not specific to any environment.
* `.env.development` - Variables that are only specific to `development` or `test` environments.
* `.env.production` - Variables that are only specific to production environment. Example: `ENTRY`.

```{shell}
# DOCKER POSTRESQL DATABASE
DEV_DB_USER='database_username'
DEV_DB_PASSWORD='database_password'
DEV_DB_NAME='database_name'

# DOMAIN
CURRENT_SITE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080/

# SENTRY
SENTRY_DNS=8.8.8.8

# COMMON_API_CREDS
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://myApiServerUrl.com
```
NB:
* Ensure you use the prefix `REACT_APP_` to store all the variables that are needed in the React Application. Example: `REACT_APP_NAME=janedoe`
* **DO NOT** commit any of the environment files to version control.

### Docker

This application is built with Docker, you will need to have the following installed in order to use it:
* `Makefile` - Use the link below to install https://makefiletutorial.com/.
* `Docker` - https://www.docker.com/.
